MOD_TWITTERWIDGET="Twitter Widget"
MOD_TWITTERWIDGET_DESCRIPTION="The idea is to allow a module from loading quickly over a slightly larger work of the developer. Instead of allowing settings and generate inline javascript, just add a javascript file exactly where you want, but you must edit the javascript directly into the desired settings.<br /><br />Each instance of the module allows different javascript files, and allows both add paths based on the root of your Joomla as well as absolute URLs.<br /><br />To know exactly the parameters you can use the file, visit https://twitter.com/about/resources/widgets, and go on the 'My Website' and use the result as a basis to change the generated javascript file. Use as the base '/modules/mod_twitterwidget/js/twitterwidget.js'"
